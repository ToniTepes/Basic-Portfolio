    I am excited to share my portfolio with you. I am a good candidate for the role, because I have experience working with many types of people, and have performed research, development, and data entry in my previous analytical positions. In addition, I have a studied computer comprehension that allows me to troubleshoot many software and hardware issues. It has been great exercise for problem solving, thinking, and seeking efficiency. I have more than a decade of diverse professional experience, including project management at Honda Research and Development, production supervision at Jeni's Splendid Ice Cream, systems and machine maintenance at Umicore Specialty Materials Recycling, and administration and engineering operations at my grandparents’ farm. This experience, and my post-secondary education, have prepared me well to assist in achieving project goals and organizational outcomes at your organization.

    Throughout my career, I have applied my aptitude for problem-solving and a technology-based education to reach any objective I set out to achieve. From a young age, my family has inspired me to work with enthusiasm and commitment. The discipline I learned from my parents, both U.S. Marine Corps service members, and my grandparents, commercial farmers, has kept me focused in work and life. My aunt, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, taught me the importance of passion, and instilled in me a drive to ask meaningful questions in order to explore new perspectives. While my formal training in writing is limited, it is bolstered by significant research and practice. I am confident in my unique style and strong voice. Being a skilled communicator easily connects me with new people. My passion for photography and visual art has connected me with a rich community of artists and makers, and given me the opportunity to organize events. Additionally, computer technology has been a favorite hobby of mine since I was a young child. I am comfortable installing and troubleshooting a variety of hardware and software. I feel this diverse life experience, combined with my strong professional skill set, has prepared me to excel at any project I will encounter in the role of Help Desk/Computer Support. As science historian James Burke said, innovation happens in the spaces between formal disciplines.

        I recently moved back to my hometown of Cleveland with my fiancee, and wish to find a position at an organization that shares my values of collaboration and commitment to community growth. I would very much like the opportunity to learn how I can meet the demands of this position and advance the overall mission of your company. Thank you for reviewing my site.
